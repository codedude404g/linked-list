Update---> I was able to break down the files in 7.asm files.

I was able to make the linker work for both cases (1 where "-o" option is used, the other where the symbols are resolved). 
most of the work involved making helper functions for the code. basically, the starter code does the fisrt pass, and writing
the second pass was not too difficult since its pretty similar to the first. 
I made functions to handle the symbol table as a linked-list, the search function will find a symbol and return its address.
the address is then converted to a 12-bit integer by print_binary_num(), and that's how I wrote the uncooked instructions.
